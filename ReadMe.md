## OVERTAKE_data

### Overview

------

- Our dataset contains about fifteen hours of driving data including easy_mode, medium_mode, hard_mode, and we record data and motion commands at 10 frames per second. The labeling contains steering angle, accelerator and brake.
- About data: Each file contains a relative number of rounds. It is noted that a round means a process from the starting point to the end point, and it is relatively easy to understand after that. The first four data denote the coordinates of X and Y,  the speed values along the X and Y directions, repsectively. The last senven data are the accelerator and brake values, the steering angle of the ego-vehicle,  the distances from the center of the ego-vehicle to the left and right lane lines of the current lane,  the distances from the center of the ego-vehicle to the left and right road boundaries, repsectively.
